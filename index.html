    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p class="introp">The purpose of this project is to show evidence of religion around the North/Clybourn CTA Red Line stop. Religion is ever-present in our environment whether we notice it or not. Symbols and evidence of religion range from things as obvious as crosses and church signs to things as subtle as telegraph wires and statues. The neighborhood of Lincoln Park and Old Town are both predominantly white, yet a range of religions are evident within the communities as shown by the images presented. Please navigate to the ‘Pictures’ page for static images, and visit the ‘Essay’ page for my full piece on the phenomena I was able to find during my search for evidence of religion.</p>

      <div class="captions">A parking lot for around 100 residents, decorated with Christmas decorations. This symbol shows the dominant religion of both Chicago and the United States, and how people are often insensitive to the desires and beliefs of others. The landlord, or a certain cavalier tenant decided the whole apartment complex will be expressive of Christian heritage.</div>

      <div class="captions">At Fullerton and Lincoln, we can see the southern bound of the Edgewater eruv. The juxtaposition of the eruv wire and a huge corporation’s location sheds light on the use and purpose of an eruv; to adapt religion to better fit into contemporary capitalist society.</div>

      <div class="captions">Located at Clybourn and Larabee, the abandoned Northside Stranger’s Home Church is now used for only secular events. The Target now occupies the land where many church residents used to live in Cabrini Green. The church remains for filming and sentimental purposes, but has not been destroyed. The mural on the side that had been there since 1972 was painted over, symbolizing the church's long fading influence on the neighborhood and its people.

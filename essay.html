    <p class="essaytxt">Chicago is a very diverse city, yet is extremely segregated both culturally and racially. Little pockets in the city provide evidence of varying religions throughout the city, and that is clear when looking around a particular CTA stop. The CTA stop I selected to analyze was North/Clybourn on the red line, my home stop, and the place I’ve grown up at for 20 years. Even though the Old Town and Lincoln Park neighborhoods are predominantly white and Christian, there are many religious places of worship, religious symbols, and architectural features that suggest the neighborhood is more religiously diverse than one might presume.</p> 
    <p class="essaytxt">First, we need to understand the predominant Christian religion of the neighborhood to have a baseline we can compare to. Providing a “control” religion for the neighborhood helps us get a sense of how prevalent the minority religions are. The most obvious evidence of Christianity, particularly Catholicism, is the presence of St. Michael’s and St. James’s churches. With the goal to highlight more obscure religious symbols in mind, I placed St. Micheal’s church as the last photo since it is the most widely recognized. There are quite a few Christian churches I found while exploring, and St. Michael’s is the prototypical idea of what Chrisitanity looks like in the landscape. It includes a few auxiliary buildings, including a rectory that has been repurposed for educational and recreational purposes, a statue dedicated to Veterans (also pictured), and St. Michael’s Hall directly adjacent  (pictured 7th). The plethora of Christian buildings and sheer square footage occupied by St. Michael’s and its related buildings show Chrisitanity’s dominance in the area, and sets our baseline for what to expect to see the most of when exploring North/Clybourn’s surrounding area. </p>
    <p class="essaytxt">St. James and St. Michael’s do share elements that suggest the neighborhood has an increasingly blurry divide between sacred and profane, as described by Durkheim. St. Michael’s Hall and the home next to St. James church are both converted church buildings, providing evidence of a decline in the congregation’s popularity and subsequent repurposing of formerly holy structures. Furthermore, the decrepit Baptist church and the Christmas tree next to the trash cans reflect this sentiment. These images show a dying image of Christianity, as the symbols we associate with the religion take up physical space in the landscape, yet serve no sentimental or religious purpose anymore. The Baptist church was abandoned when the Cabrini Green Towers, formerly at Larrabee and Division, were torn down to make way for the Target seen in the background. This, coupled with the juxtaposition of the Christmas tree next to the trash can (an image I came across no less than 5 times) provides a metaphor for what religion is seen as for many young adults; a thing of the past, no longer in use or needed for the lives of many. Even though these images of fading religiosity might dominate one’s presumption of the religious landscape, some images provide evidence of the contrary. The wreath on the large apartment complex’s parking gate, the architecture on the Halsted storefront, and the stained glass on the front of the home on Fremont all show the lasting legacy of Christianity in the neighborhood. Christianity is still accepted as the dominant religion, yet the religious spaces hold less significance than they once did. </p>
    <p class="essaytxt">This religious evolution, per se, is most obvious when looking at modern churches and churches outside of the Christian umbrella. The Jehova’s Witness location, the Church of The Three Crosses, and the Midwest Buddhist Temple are all within half a mile of St. Michael’s. Each of them has more visible foot traffic and public use than St. Michael’s or St. James (save for the St. James school, which serves as a gathering space daily.), which frames the shift in religious affiliation that may be occurring in the neighborhood. The contemporary Christian church, the Church of the Three Crosses, shows a very different side of Christianity than St. Michael’s and St. James church; its progressive nature works in its favor, providing a more welcoming space for younger people in the neighborhood. My exploration concluded with seeking out the southern bound of the Edgewater eruv on Fullerton. This suggests that those of Jewish faith (particularly devout Jews) are located north of the area around North/Clybourn. This is confirmed by the lack of Menorahs and Hanukkah-colored decorations I saw on my walks. On my way home from Fullerton, I saw a curious garden next to the Brown line L tracks on Dayton, less than 500 feet from the entrance to the North/Clybourn station. The garden includes a statue of Buddha, an American flag, a bird bath with an angel on it, and an evergreen tree. These conflicting symbols summarize the neighborhood quite well in my eyes; a predominantly Christian neighborhood (as is the case with the United States as a whole) that is welcoming to other religions (such as Buddhism) and is increasingly blurring the lines both between religions and within religions. My images are consistent with this message, and if you are ever to explore the neighborhood, I believe you would reach the same conclusion.</p>
